# HAND-VOLUME-CONTROL
Designed and developed a hand volume control model using Mediapipe library's hand tracking module, which accurately detects and tracks hand gestures in real-time. The volume control is then adjusted based on the position of the hand, allowing for an intuitive and hands-free way to adjust the volume of a device.
Required python version is 3.9.13, the above versions doesn't support mediapipe library.
